RedSpace Coding Challenge
===========================

Description
-----------

A simple react app that gets info about Star Wars characters based on their id from swap.io.

Dependencies
------------

 - Node
 - Git

Installation
------------

Clone the project run npm i and then npm start. This should open a browser running the app app if not please go to localhost:3000

TO DOs
------
A few things I would have liked to set up given more time.

- Set up redux - given the size of the app I wouldn't use redux however as a way of showing knowledge and maintaining scalability redux would be a nice addition.
- Add testing - The testing environment was already set up and adding a few tests would have been nice
- Revamp app look - I'm no designer but I feel like the overall feel of the app could be better. Maybe incorporate a more appropriate star wars theme. ie star wars fonts etc
